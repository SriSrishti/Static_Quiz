# Static_Quiz
Creating a quiz application in Python involves designing an interactive interface that presents questions, collects user responses, and evaluates their answers. The application can be static (using predefined questions). A typical implementation includes:

Question Storage: Hardcoded in a list (static).
User Interface: Built with tkinter for labels, and radio buttons.
Logic Handling: Checking answers, keeping track of scores, and moving to the next question.
Result Display: Showing the final score after all questions are answered.
